**JARVIS - AI-Based Conversational Assistant**

**Description**
JARVIS is an AI-based conversational assistant that leverages cutting-edge open-source models for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. Designed to provide a seamless conversational experience, JARVIS is capable of understanding natural language input through voice and responding with synthesized speech. The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit-based GUI, allowing users to interact with JARVIS using voice commands.
