**JARVIS - AI-Based Conversational Assistant**

**Description**
JARVIS is an AI-based conversational assistant that leverages cutting-edge open-source models for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. Designed to provide a seamless conversational experience, JARVIS is capable of understanding natural language input through voice and responding with synthesized speech. The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit-based GUI, allowing users to interact with JARVIS using voice commands.

**Features**
1. Speech Recognition: Utilizes advanced STT models to accurately transcribe user speech into text.
2. Conversational AI: Employs OpenAI's GPT model for natural language understanding and generation.
3. Text-to-Speech: Converts JARVIS's textual responses back into lifelike speech using state-of-the-art TTS models.
4. Streamlit GUI: Simple and intuitive interface for voice recording and receiving audio responses.
